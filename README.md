# Threads Social Network Analysis (Java)

This project demonstrates Social Network Analysis using Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Concepts Used

- Graph (Adjacency List)
- HashMap
- ArrayList
- Queue (BFS)
- HashSet
- Degree Centrality
- Shortest Path (Breadth-First Search)

## Description

The social network is modeled as a directed graph:
- Nodes represent users
- Edges represent follow relationships

The program computes:
- Network structure
- Degree centrality
- Shortest path between users

## Output

The program generates analysis results in output.txt.
